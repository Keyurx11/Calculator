Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/Keyurx11/Calculator.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd Calculator`

Open the index.html file in your web browser to use the calculator.

The calculator should now be operational. You can perform basic arithmetic operations by entering numbers and clicking the corresponding buttons.
